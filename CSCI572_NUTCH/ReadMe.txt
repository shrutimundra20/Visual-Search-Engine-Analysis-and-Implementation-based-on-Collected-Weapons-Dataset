1. We changed the configuration filters of Nutch and used various commands to run the crawl scripts.

2. We installed NutchPy to get the MimeType data and analyzed it 

3. Installed Selenium with Firefox 30 and created two Custom handlers. One was for Login and one for search and pagination. The corresponding files have been attached in the corresponding folder.

4. Successfully installed Tika and tesseract. Then we changed, the Tika OCR config properties to extract the data from images

5. At this step we crawled again to remove the parsing and authentication(HTTP-403)errors. 

6. We have attached the total Mime Statistics as snapshots - MimeStats_1,MimeStats_2 and MimeStats_3.
